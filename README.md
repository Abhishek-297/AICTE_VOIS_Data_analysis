## 🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data analysis pipeline, from data loading and cleaning to exploratory data analysis (EDA) and interactive visualization. The primary objective is to uncover patterns, trends, and key metrics within the dataset and present them with clear, interactive visualizations.

The main analysis is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook that serves as a reproducible report of the entire process.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python 3  
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, plotly, matplotlib, seaborn, (and other standard data analysis tools)  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Key Features of the Analysis

The notebook (`AICTE VOIS Internship Project.ipynb`) covers:

1. **Data Loading & Inspection**
   - Importing dataset(s), checking structure, shape, and data types.
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values, type conversions, normalization, and other preprocessing steps to prepare the data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Descriptive statistics, univariate and bivariate analysis, and identification of correlations and important influencers.
4. **Data Visualization**
   - Interactive Plotly charts including:
     - Line charts (trends over time)
     - Bar charts & histograms (categorical distributions)
     - Scatter plots (relationships between variables)
     - Pie charts (composition)
   - Visuals are designed to be clear, informative, and story-driven.

## 📈 Results & Insights

The analysis identified several key trends and patterns (summarized inside the notebook and final presentation). Interactive visualizations make it easy to explore the dataset and validate hypotheses. Please open the notebook and the presentation for the detailed findings and visual summaries.

## 📖 How to Run / Reproduce Locally

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abhishek-297/AICTE_VOIS_Data_analysis.git
   cd AICTE_VOIS_Data_analysis

2.**Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)**
   
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate      # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate'
3.**Install required packages**
   
    pip install jupyter pandas numpy plotly matplotlib seabor


4.**Launch Jupyter Notebook**
    
    jupyter notebook


5.**Open and run the notebook**

In the Jupyter interface, click AICTE VOIS Internship Project.ipynb.

Run cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.




Note: The original dataset used in this internship is not included in the repository (privacy/proprietary reasons). Replace the data loading step with your own dataset to run the notebook.
